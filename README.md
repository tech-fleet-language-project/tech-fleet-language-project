Tech Fleet's on a mission to create fair access to tech careers. 

We aspire to make tech careers a reality for anyone. People without industry experience deserve a chance to succeed, regardless of background. We want to close the talent gap by providing skill-building opportunities and a supportive community to those typically excluded from our industry. Tech Fleet partners with businesses who support our mission and align with our values. 

We aim to help unlock success for 10,000 individuals by 2030. We'll track our progress and involve specialists to hold us accountable.
